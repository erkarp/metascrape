emily@Emily:~/Documents/WDS/wds$ This is Ruth Haynes’ piano in its new home.  Our home.  In her will, she left it to us. This display of her devotion is in keeping with Ruth as a member.   After being an active part of our congregation for many decades, she continued to show up.  She paid attention.  She was upbeat and made helpful suggestions. When asked, she said, “yes.” Just last year we asked her to serve on a panel for a Platform. She was a wonderful panel member. Ruth lit up the place when she walked into the room. She had an easy smile and a warm greeting for everyone.

emily@Emily:~/Documents/WDS/wds$ This piano will remind us of the care she took of the Society. In return, we will care for the maintenance of this magnificent gift.  Her contribution to the room where she spent many happy times continues in the form of a beautiful baby grand. This treasure is a display of the love Ruth Haynes had for the Ethical Culture Society. In truth, we loved her back.
